# ply.loader
Ply point cloud file loader for Max

To use, clone or download the repo and add to your Max search path (e.g. by dragging the entire folder into ~/Documents/Max 8/Library). In a new patch create a **ply.loader** object and check the help file for usage. 

For first time usage, double click the **ply.loader** abstraction and click the _script npm install_ message box

As part of the file loading process, matrix binary files are written to the same folder containing the patch and scripts.
